# Development Todos

- Parse commandline arguments (and pass them on to fava), e.g., see `do_commandline` in https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/application.html#application
- Display File Name in header bar (possible by binding the header bar to an observable property?)
- Consider building a mac package?
- Add unit tests for the GTK ui
- Add internationalization? (maybe evaluate/use https://github.com/gnome-keysign/babel-glade, not sure if needed)
- Find a way to use the same version number in different places: in git tags and github releases, in setup.cfg, as well as in the flatpak package metadata
