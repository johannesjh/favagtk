# Todos

- Test manually

- Release builds should not have the striped "work-in-progress" window styling.
  - Set the "release" build profile if building a tagged release.
  - Create a gitlab release from the artifacts that were built?

- Publish on flathub

- Delete the favagtk project over on pypi

- Do I need to sandbox webkit?, as proposed in this initiative:
  https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/Initiatives/-/wikis/Sandbox-all-the-WebKit!

  - Note: Do a regression test to see if documents can still be added
    by dragging them unto a fava journal entry.
    
- Enable dark mode 
  - Ask upstream if fava wants to support dark mode styling too,
    the feature only really makes sense if fava's web content is dark as well.
