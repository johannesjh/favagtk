# Todos

- Add a CI workflow.
  - Consider using GNOME infrastructure instead of github?
    not sure what is easier.

- Use "profiles" instead of "buildtypes" for debug vs. release app builds,
  compare https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/Initiatives/-/wikis/DevOps-with-Flatpak#final-gitlab-yaml-file-template

- Publish on flathub

- Add screenshots to the README and to the appstream file.

  - Examples for how to add screenshots can be found in merge requests
    that are linked in the GNOME screenshots initiative
    https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/Initiatives/-/issues/34

- Consider sandboxing webkit, as proposed in this initiative:
  https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/Initiatives/-/wikis/Sandbox-all-the-WebKit!

  - Note: Do a regression test to see if documents can still be added
    by dragging them unto a fava journal entry.
