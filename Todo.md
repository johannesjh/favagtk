- Enable dark mode

  - See https://gitlab.gnome.org/johannesjh/favagtk/-/issues/9
  - Make sure the GTK window and widgets respect the system's dark mode,
    see https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/tutorials/beginners/getting_started/dark_mode.html
  - Ask upstream if fava wants to support dark mode styling too,
    the feature only really makes sense if fava's web content is dark as well.

- automatic dependency updates
  - see https://gitlab.gnome.org/johannesjh/favagtk/-/issues/8
  - see https://thacoon.gitlab.io/posts/gitlab-ci-auto-dependency-update/
